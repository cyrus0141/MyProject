    INTRODUCTION
In an era marked by the fusion of technology and convenience, the university dining experience remains an untapped frontier ripe for innovation. Due to this, I came up with a project "Campus Eats", a revolutionary mobile application designed to transform how students, faculty, and staff engage with dining options on campus. Born out of a deep understanding of the challenges faced by university communities in navigating the often fragmented and limited dining landscape, "Campus Eats" aims to revolutionize the way individuals discover, order, and enjoy food while on campus.
At its core, Campus Eats is more than just a food delivery app, it is a gateway to a world of culinary delights, community engagement, and convenience. With Campus Eats, users can effortlessly discover nearby dining options, place orders for pickup or delivery, coordinate group meals with friends or colleagues, and engage with the campus community through shared dining experiences and recommendations. By leveraging the power of technology and partnerships with local restaurants and campus dining services, Campus Eats empowers users to elevate their dining experience, save time, and explore new flavors and cuisines - all within the vibrant ecosystem of university life.


    STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM 
Despite the diverse needs and preferences of university students, faculty, and staff, accessing convenient, healthy, and affordable dining options on campus remains a significant challenge. Traditional methods of finding and ordering food often involve long wait times, limited choices, and disjointed processes, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction among members of the university community. Furthermore, the lack of centralized information and resources compounds the issue, making it difficult for individuals to make informed decisions about where and what to eat. As a result, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive solution that streamlines the campus dining experience, empowers users to make better dining choices, fosters community engagement, and supports the local food ecosystem. This project seeks to address these challenges by developing a user-friendly mobile application, "Campus Eats," designed to revolutionize the way university students, faculty, and staff discover, order, and enjoy food on campus.
